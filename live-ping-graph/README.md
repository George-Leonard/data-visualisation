Run the graph.py file and then run the pingfeed.py file to begin a continuous stream of live ping (to google.com) data to be written into a text named
PINGINFO.txt (automatically created). The graph will loop, plotting the data in the PINGINFO.txt file, using the prebuilt matplotlib animation function.
Scroll over the graph to find the ping at a particular time.
